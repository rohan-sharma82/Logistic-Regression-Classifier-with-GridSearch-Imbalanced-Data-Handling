**# ü©∫ CHD Risk Prediction - Logistic Regression Model**

This project uses a real-world dataset from the **Framingham Heart Study** to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a person is at risk of developing **Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** within the next 10 years.

---

**## üìä Dataset Overview**

The dataset consists of **4,238 patient records** with demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors. It is commonly used for predicting heart disease risk using supervised machine learning.

### üéØ Target Variable
- `TenYearCHD`: 
  - `1` ‚Üí Patient developed CHD in the next 10 years
  - `0` ‚Üí Patient did not develop CHD

**## üß† Project Objectives**

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Handle missing values
- Build a **Logistic Regression** model
- Use **GridSearchCV** to tune hyperparameters
- Apply **class balancing techniques** to handle imbalanced data
- Evaluate model using classification metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

---

**## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack**

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling, preprocessing, and evaluation

---

**## üìà Model Performance**

| Metric        | Value     |
|---------------|-----------|
| Accuracy      | 68.5%     |
| Recall (CHD=1)| 68%       |
| F1-Score (CHD=1) | 0.41   |

> While accuracy dropped from 85% to 68.5%, the recall for the minority class improved significantly ‚Äî from **6% to 68%**, making the model much more reliable for medical screening.
